## About

BFG package for Ubuntu 20.04. This is a repackage of the jar build, so it should work for any Debian derivative, provided the OpenJDK 11 JRE dependency is met.

BFG removes large or troublesome blobs like git-filter-branch does for git repositories, but faster.

## Build

```bash
bundle exec rake build:all
```
